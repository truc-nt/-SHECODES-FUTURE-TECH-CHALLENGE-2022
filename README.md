# **ALBUM ABOUT MY FUTURE FAMILY TRIPS**

## **Introduction**

This is a project which I compete in SHECODES FUTURE TECH CHALLENGE 2022. The topic of the competition is an album 
preserving our photos, thoughts, and memories of a memorable journey or planning my future dream trips with my family. Since I didn't have many family travel so I decided to make a plan for my future family trips. 

## **Build with**

I built this project with Reactjs. In the beginning, I decided to code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because, at that time, I had little knowledge about Reactjs. But in the end, I decided to use Reactjs. That was an interesting experience when I had to learn and code simultaneously in a short period of time, at least for me.

I didn't use any CSS Frameworks, I did it all by myself. At first, it took me too much time to style with CSS. However, later, I got used to and understand more about how CSS worked.
I knew there had been another way to make CSS more professional, faster and clearer with SASS/SCSS but I didn't have enough time to learn about SASS/SCSS so my CSS files were quite long.

Through this project, I have learned a lot of things. How to use state, ref in React, how to deploy a Reactjs website on Github,... And for CSS, I think that somehow CSS became more clear to me. I understand how flexbox works, how display works,...

The project is designed liked a photobook in real life. We can open the album and read its contents like you are reading a book.

* ### *The content* ###

Each page has its own style, meanings. I had put all my story and feeling about this topic through this project.

Due to lack of writing skill in English, I wrote my thought in my mother tongue - VietNamese. I want to express the story of myself in the most complete and meaningful way.
